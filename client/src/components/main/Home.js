                    <p>
                    Hi there! I go by the name Tuyen and I was born in Vietnam but grew up in the United States. Nature has always held a special place in my heart, especially the beauty of sunrises and sunsets. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and capturing those breathtaking moments through photography.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Becoming a mother at a young age presented its fair share of challenges, making it difficult for me to pursue a career that truly ignited my passion. Instead, I had to prioritize survival and raising my son as a single mother. I ended up working in the hospitality industry for over ten years, gaining valuable experience in customer service and management.

                        <br />
                        However, last year, I made a life-changing decision. I seized the opportunity to become a stay-at-home mother so that I could finally pursue my dream career in Software Development. The world of Software Engineering had always fascinated me, but I doubted my abilities and hesitated to take the leap into a boot camp. After careful consideration, I realized that life is too short to hesitate, so I enrolled in Flatiron School and embarked on my journey as a Software Engineer.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Today, I am incredibly proud to not only call myself a mother but also a driven Software Engineer.
