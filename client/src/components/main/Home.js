Hello! I'm Tuyen, and I am absolutely captivated by the beauty of nature, especially sunsets and sunrises. There is something so magical and awe-inspiring about witnessing the colors dance across the sky, and I can't help but feel a sense of peacefulness and wonder in those moments.
<br /><br />
When I'm not out in nature, experiencing these breathtaking scenes firsthand, I am passionately pursuing my dream career in Software Development. It hasn't always been an easy path, as doubts and uncertainties often crept into my mind. However, I decided to take a leap of faith and enrolled in the Flatiron School to gain the knowledge and skills needed to become a Software Engineer.
<br /><br />
Now, I can proudly say that I am a Software Engineer, combining my love for technology with my passion for problem-solving and creating innovative solutions. Every day is a new adventure as I continue to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field. I am grateful for the opportunities that have come my way and excited for what the future holds.
